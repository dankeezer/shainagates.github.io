  <span class="heading">SHAINA GATES - Current work</span></div></br>
  My work is centered around the ways black and white film is able to directly visualize the dimensionality and elasticity of light and environment as color and image.<p> 
  In this body of work, I'm using handmade camera-like devices to record and abserve the way sunlight moves and folds its way through space. <p>
  These "cameras" experiment with non-traditional apertures, lenses, and other refractive and focusing elements. As the sun casts its image through these stationary objects, the image continues to change--becoming "animated" by the sun's movement.  <p>
